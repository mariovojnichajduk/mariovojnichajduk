As a C# and JavaScript developer with around 2.5 years of experience at Noubis Services d.o.o. and over 2.5 years at ComData d.o.o., I have gained expertise in both backend and frontend development, with a primary focus on C#.

Programming Languages:
JavaScript, TypeScript, C#

Backend:
Postgres, NestJS, AdminBro, TypeORM, Bcrypt, Firebase, Firestore, MySQL, .NET 8, Entity Framework Core

Frontend:
HTML, CSS, React

Cross-platform:
MAUI, ReactiveUI, RealmDB

At the beginning of my career, I aimed to become a C# developer, which led me to gain foundational experience in Object-Oriented Programming, C++, C#, Entity Framework, and GraphQL. Over time, I have specialized in C# development, particularly in ASP.NET, MAUI, and WPF.

Beyond technical expertise, I have worked in mid-sized teams (around 20 people) on several interesting projects.

Currently, I am expanding my knowledge by learning AI technologies and further deepening my expertise in MAUI. I have a strong passion for continuous learning and staying up to date with the latest technologies, and I am always eager to take on new challenges to grow my skills.
